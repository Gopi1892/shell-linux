SonarQube: An open-source platform that performs continuous inspection of code quality and security vulnerabilities.
Checkmarx: Offers SAST capabilities for identifying vulnerabilities in source code.
Fortify Static Code Analyzer: Provides static analysis to identify security issues in source code.
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): An open-source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
Burp Suite: A popular platform for performing security testing of web applications.
Acunetix: Automated web application security testing tool.
Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
